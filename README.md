# Carsten Jorgensen FSSF

* Implement a domain model for a directed graph and implement an algorithm to check that the graph contains no cycles.
* write F# “wrapper” for easy of use RabbitMQ (including support for priority queues) and/or Kafka from F# (so it feels more functional)
* Write some sample app in F# using CQRS and Event Store
* Implement some sort of (light) support for dependent types in F#. This is a stretch project. I recently learned about dependent types in Idris. The canonically dependent type is a vector of fixed size. At compile type one will get a warning if you try to zip to vectors of different length. I have no idea if something like this is remotely possible in F#.
